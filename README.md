# Text-classification
## Aim: To predict the product category from the product description for an ecommerce website.

### Programming language used: Python 3.7.4 (Anaconda)
### Development environment used: Jupyter Notebook

### Python libraries used
__Pandas__: <br/>
pandas is a powerful and flexible open source library for data analysis and
manipulation. It offers data structures: DataFrames and Series that represent
data in a tabular form, and also provides methods to analyse, filter and
manipulate the data. It is imported with the standard alias pd.

__Matplotlib__: <br/>
Matplotlib is a powerful data visualization library that allows us to draw graphs
and charts from the data in a pandas dataframe. The pyplot module of the
library is the most useful library for the plotting of graphs and is imported with
the standard alias plt.

__Seaborn__: <br/>
seaborn is a data visualization tool based on matplotlib. It provides high level
interface for drawing attractive and informative graphs. It is imported with the
alias sns.

__Scikit-learn (sklearn)__: <br/>
Scikit-learn is a powerful library that is commonly used to build machine
learning models. It supports classification, regression, and clustering algorithms.
It also provides tools for data preprocessing and evaluation metrics for a
machine learning model.

__Accuracy achieved__: <br/>
95% training accuracy and 93% testing accuracy
